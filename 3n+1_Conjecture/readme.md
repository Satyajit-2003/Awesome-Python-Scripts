## The 3n + 1 Conjecture

The 3n + 1 conjecture is an unsolved mathematical problem concerning a sequence defined as follows:

1. Start with any positive integer n.
2. If n is even, divide it by 2.
3. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1.
5. The conjecture states that no matter what positive integer you start with, the sequence will always eventually reach 1.

### Example:

Start with the number 13.

```13 * 3 + 1 = 40
40 / 2 = 20
20 / 2 = 10
10 / 2 = 5
5 * 3 + 1 = 16
16 / 2 = 8
8 / 2 = 4
4 / 2 = 2
2 / 2 = 1
```

This python program will take a number as input and will print the sequence of numbers that are generated by the above rules. The program will also count the number of steps required to reach 1.

To use this program, clone the repo and run the following command in your terminal:

```python main.py```

Have fun exploring the 3n + 1 conjecture!
